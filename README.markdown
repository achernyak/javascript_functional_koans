# Javascript Functional Koans - Functional Programming for the Rest of Us#

This is inspired by Edgecase's [Ruby
koans](http://github.com/edgecase/ruby_koans) and the suite is
forked from [Javascript koans](https://github.com/mrdavidlaing/javascript-koans)

The goal of Javascript functional koans is to teach basic functional
programming concepts using Javascript. It is based on the article:
[Functional Programming for the Rest of Us](http://www.defmacro.org/ramblings/fp.html).

It uses the koans philosophy to teach the following concepts:

1. Functions as First class objects
2. Recursion
3. Higher order functions
4. Currying
5. Lazy evaluation
6. Continuations
7. Pattern matching

The koans will stick to the original article.

### Running the Koans from a Browser

Navigate to the Javascript functional Koans folder using a file browser, and
